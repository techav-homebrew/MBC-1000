The MBC-1000 chassis has holes for a card support bracket for each slot, but the brackets may not be populated for any cards not purchased with the computer. Original part number was Kal-am `051-44-001-41`. 

The FreeCAD & exported step file were created from measuring an original part. It should be possible to 3D print the bracket from these files, but they are untested.
