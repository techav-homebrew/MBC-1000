MBC-1000 supports up to 4 expansion cards. Cards not present will need a blank slot cover. Each slot is 17mm wide and 73.3mm tall. Slot covers are made from L-shaped powder-coated or painted steel. 

The FreeCAD and exported files were created from measuring an original part. It should be possible to fabircate or 3D print the slot cover from these files, but they are untested.
